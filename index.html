		<h1>What is the story of the fight?</h1>
		<p>
			Just as a book reads from left to right - start to finish, so does a fight. It can start as soon as the referee shouts out "Fight!". The engagement begins and after a few minutes it ends. There a story within these minutes - what each character is feeling, the sensation as time slows down to a near halt. Or the feeling of how quickly time seems to pass. What are they thinking? Are they thinking too much? 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			There is a story outside of these minutes as well. The build up. How did these two end up fighting each other? How did each prepare their mind and body for this short period of time? There is a story that can started way before these two decided to compete. A story that did not have a clear beginning or end. It captures the countless hours of untold struggle in the practice rooms. The story reads the thoughts of the athele - the confidence that flickers like a small flame. It can be extinguished in a single moment or suddenly set the world ablaze. Moments of extreme joy as well as times where he or she has given up. The story shows the ebb and flow of our walk through life.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			As these two fighters stare across the cage at each other, know that this story isn't about to start, and regardless of the outcome it will not end for both fighters. The story to this fight began many years ago... and will continue for many years to come... This is the story of the fight.
