			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Vincent. I've been involved with combat sports and martial arts since I was ten years old - which puts me at 15 years. However, it wasn't until I was 13 that I became passionate about the sport. Bruce Lee was an early inspiration of mine. When I was 15, I first heard about Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) from a wrestler on the high school Judo team. I ended up checking out UFC 1 from the local Blockbuster and the rest was history - I was hooked. From then, I've spent a majority of time training in various martial arts - Notably: Sambo, Judo, Grappling, and Muay Thai. I've made an effort to travel and train at many different gyms coaches - always trying to be as open minded possible. I owe a lot to Lion's Way Martial Arts, Seatown Sambo, Don Bratz, Joseph Tumvim, Tristar Gym, Tony Deva, and AMC Pankration. These are the groups and coaches that have largely influenced my thoughts.</p>
